# citizen-service-request

Citizen Service Request is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a HTML 5 / JavaScript application that allows citizens to submit requests for service in their community. It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, or tablet device.
